# Real-time-GPU-based-Bezier-Curve-Mesh-Mapping-and-Generation-GPU-
This project was developed between May 28 and June 1, 2024, during my final exam week. Inspired by a friend's request for "freely controllable rope generation" in 3D environments, I utilized the IdeaXR engine to create this mesh deformation system based on Vertex Shaders.
